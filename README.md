# Emotion-Detection-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This project was for our course "Artificial Intelligence" for the semester "Fall 2020". In this project, we used ANNs to detect the emotion in an image. The neural network was made on Python from scratch without using any libraries apart from numpy. The network was trained on 5 classes (happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral). The network had one hidden layer with 80 neurons and adam was used as the optimization algorithm for faster convergence. The train accuracy that we were able to achieve was 99% and the test accuracy was 93%.
