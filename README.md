# Emotion Detection using Artificial Neural Networks
This project was for our course "Artificial Intelligence" for the semester "Fall 2020". In this project, we used ANNs to detect the emotion in an image. The neural network was made on Python from scratch without using any libraries apart from numpy. The network was trained on 5 classes (happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral). The network had one hidden layer with 80 neurons and adam was used as the optimization algorithm for faster convergence. The train accuracy that we were able to achieve was 99% and the test accuracy was 93%.

# Files
The "Neural_Network_Trainer.ipynb" can be used via google colab or jupyter notebook. The notebook will train the network on the dataset attached and the parameters (weights and biases) and the two encoders can then be downloaded in the same folder as the python file is downloaded. The python file attached is the GUI which can be used to test the network in real time.
